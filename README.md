#User Story:

As an art collector, I want a virtual art gallery app that displays works of art in a dynamic gallery 
based on an artist's name using the Artsy API. I can view current works by that artist for sale on eBay 
as I browse, and save galleries I enjoy to view or share later.  


#Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN that I want to display my art collection virtually
WHEN I visit the page I can view a list of artists I like
THEN I can add or remove artwork from the list
WHEN I click on each artist, I can view their work in a virtual gallery
THEN I can scroll through the gallery back and forth
WHEN I click on a specific artwork
THEN I can see that specific artwork up close
WHEN I have a particular collection I enjoy
THEN I can save it for later or find if it's for sale
