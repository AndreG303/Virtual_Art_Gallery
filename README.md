## User Story:

As a collector of Magic the Gathering Cards, I want a virtual art gallery app that displays works of art from the cards in a dynamic gallery based on the object in the art or the card name. I can then in turn save the art to my dropbox account as I browse, and save pictures I enjoy to view or share later.  

## Goals
````
Phase 1: A working gallery app that can retrieve artwork with AJAX request and display them to the page 
Phase 2: Link the application to dropbox API to drag and drop card art
Phase 3: Ability to share collection with others
