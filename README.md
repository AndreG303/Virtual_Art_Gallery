## User Story:

Our project began life as a virtual card binder, to search and display clickable thumbnails of collectible cards as one would organically. The concept featured the ability to piece together desired collections and then save that binder for later viewing. 

While brainstorming ideas, we took it back to its root concept, because one could view and share collections of anything from stamps to fine art with this same concept. We settled on a dynamic fine art gallery, but ran into difficulty with our initial API. We decided to have it instead pull from a database of fantasy artwork. we also attempted to utilize an Ebay  search API , but with more thoughts from them team we came up with using the Giphy API to make the application more humorous and fun.

## Technology

The application we built utilized HTML, the Materialize framework, and CSS style sheets coupled with Javascript and Jquery functionality. The APIâ€™s we used for the project were Scryfall (API for Magic Cards), GIPHY (for random GIFs and Images) and Dropbox (for direct download). 

## Features

As a collector of Magic the Gathering Cards, I want a virtual art gallery app that displays works of art from the cards in a dynamic gallery based on the object in the art or the card name. The random button will also trigger a random giphy. I can then in turn save the art to my dropbox account as I browse, and save the pictures I enjoy to view or share later.  

## Acceptance Criteria
````
Phase 1: A working gallery app that can retrieve artwork with AJAX request and display them to the page 
Phase 2: Link the GIPHY API to display a random gif image with the card artwork
Phase 3: Link the application to dropbox API to drag and drop card art
